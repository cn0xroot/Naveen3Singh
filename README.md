### Hi there 👋

I'm a computer nerd learning the ins and outs of computer science all by myself.

- 🔭 I’m currently working with/learning Android development. I know Java, Kotlin, Python and vacation C++ 😁
- 💬 Ask me about mobile, linux, or anything random.
- 😎 Feel free to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Naveen3Singh) or anywhere you can find me!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- ⚡ Fun fact: I live in the country side far from cities and I never went to college.
